Portfolio Optimization Tool (Python)

Overview:
This project shows how data and simple math can be used to build better investment portfolios.
Using past stock market data, the program creates a portfolio that aims to lower risk while still
keeping good returns.

To see the difference, the optimized portfolio is compared with a basic equal weight portfolio.
This helps show why diversification and data based decisions are important.

Tools Used:
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  
- yfinance  
- Jupyter Notebook  


What does the Project do?
1. Downloads historical stock price data  
2. Calculates daily returns from prices  
3. Measures risk and how stocks move together  
4. Finds the best portfolio weights to reduce risk  
5. Compares the optimized portfolio with an equal-weight portfolio  
6. Shows the results using a risk vs return chart  

Results: 
The optimized portfolio had lower risk and higher returns than the equal weight portfolio.
This shows that using data and diversification can improve investment decisions.


Demonstrated Skills:
- Understanding risk and return  
- Portfolio diversification  
- Basic quantitative finance  
- Data analysis with Python  
- Data visualization  

Future Improvements
- Add Sharpe Ratio to measure risk adjusted performance   
- Let users choose their own stocks and dates  
- Turn the project into a simple web app
